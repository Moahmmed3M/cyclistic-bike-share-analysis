# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis 🚲

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study.
The goal is to analyze bike-share usage data to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## Business Task
How do casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, and how can these insights help convert casual riders into annual members?

## Dataset
- Source: Divvy / Cyclistic public bike-share data
- Period analyzed: Q1 2020
- Tool used for analysis: Google Sheets

## Tools Used
- Google Sheets
  - Data cleaning
  - Pivot tables
  - Calculated fields
  - Data visualization (charts)

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed rows with missing or invalid ride length values
- Converted ride length into time format
- Created a new column for day of week
- Ensured consistent formatting across all columns

## Analysis & Key Findings
- Casual riders have significantly longer average ride durations than members
- Members tend to take shorter, more frequent rides, suggesting commuting behavior
- Casual riders are more active on weekends, while members ride consistently throughout the week

## Visualizations
Key visualizations include:
- Average ride length by user type
- Average ride length by day of week
- Comparison of casual vs member riding patterns

## Recommendations
- Promote weekend and leisure-based membership plans
- Offer trial or short-term memberships for casual riders
- Target marketing campaigns around peak casual usage days

## Conclusion
Casual riders primarily use Cyclistic bikes for leisure, while members use them for routine transportation.
Understanding these patterns can help Cyclistic design targeted strategies to increase membership conversions.
